# HARDWARE

A major feature of the Dynamic Web TWAIN library is to interact with imaging devices like scanners, cameras, etc. The following shows the devices that are supported.

## TWAIN scanners

![Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-1]({{site.assets}}imgs/Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-1.png)

`TWAIN Scanners` refer to image scanners which have drivers that follow the TWAIN standard.

* Facts about TWAIN

  + TWAIN is an application programming interfaces (API) and communication protocol that regulate communication between software and digital imaging devices, such as image scanners and digital cameras. 

  + TWAIN is supported on Microsoft Windows, Linux and macOS X. However, based on our experience and the experience of many of our customers, TWAIN only works well on Windows. On Linux, [ `SANE` ](#sane-scanners) is the better and preferred alternative; on macOS, [ `ICA` ](#ica-scanners) is the better and preferred alternative.

  + TWAIN is being actively maintained by the non-profit [TWAIN Working Group](https://www.twain.org/). Members of the group include many scanner vendors and imaging software vendors including FUJITSU, Panasonic, Epson, HP, ExactCODE, LEADTOOLS, and of course Dynamsoft.

  + TWAIN is [the most commonly used protocol](https://www.twain.org/why-twain/) for image capturing and processing. Almost all scanners on the market come with a TWAIN driver and are supported by TWAIN Applications like our DWT library.

* Is my scanner TWAIN compliant

  After you have installed the drivre for your scanner, you can refer to the following ways to verify whether your scanner is TWAIN compliant

  + [Recommended & Easiest] Take advantage of our official demo page

    - Open the [demo page](https://demo.dynamsoft.com/dwt/online_demo_scan.aspx) on [Windows]({{site.getstarted}}platform.html#browsers-on-windows)

    > If you haven't installed the library, a dialog will show up for you to download and install

    - Make sure the scanner driver shows up in the scanner list

    ![Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-5]({{site.assets}}imgs/Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-5.png)

    - Try scanning to make sure it works correctly without any errors

  + [Recommended] Use the tool called `Twacker` which is developed by the [TWAIN Working Group](http://www.twain.org/)

    - Download and install
      
      > In most cases, please dowload the 32-bit one

      - [32-bit](http://download.dynamsoft.com/tool/Twack_32.msi)
      - [64-bit](http://download.dynamsoft.com/tool/Twack_64.msi)

    - Open the program

    ![Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-6]({{site.assets}}imgs/Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-6.png)

    - Select your device

    ![Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-7]({{site.assets}}imgs/Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-7.png)

    > If your device is not listed, please check if the driver is installed. Or, you can try running `Twacker` as "Admin" to see if it shows up.

    - Choose the settings and try scanning

    ![Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-8]({{site.assets}}imgs/Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-8.png)

    > If the scanning is successful without any errors, then your device should be TWAIN compliant. You can also try other commands and see how it works. If your scanner doesn’t work with `TWACKER` , please check your scanner model online and make sure you have installed the (latest) TWAIN driver.

    ![Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-9]({{site.assets}}imgs/Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-9.png)

  + Refer to the official [twain-certified-drivers](http://resource.twain.org/twain-certified-drivers/). 

  > This list is maintained by hardware vendors and could be incomplete which means you might not find your device there. In this case, try the two ways above instead.

* No Scanner to test

  If you don't have a TWAIN scanner at hand to test the library. You can download and use a virtual scanner. 

  + [32-bit virtual scanner](http://www.dynamsoft.com/download/TWAIN/twainds.win32.installer.2.1.3.msi)
  + [64-bit virtual scanner](http://www.dynamsoft.com/download/TWAIN/twainds.win64.installer.2.1.3.msi)

### TWAIN and WIA

`WIA` refers to [Windows Image Acquisition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wia/-wia-startpage) which is the still image acquisition platform in the Windows family that enables imaging/graphics applications to interact with imaging hardware and standardizes the interaction between different applications and scanners. 

`WIA` devices can be used by `TWAIN` applications like the Dynamic Web TWAIN library through a so-called `TWAIN compatibility layer` . This means `WIA` is not supported natively, therefore, when a device supports both `TWAIN` and `WIA` , `TWAIN` is the better option.

By comparison, `WIA` can only control a very limited set of general capabilities of the devices while `TWAIN` can control all standard and even custom capabilities of the devices. Another thing is that, `TWAIN` has three transfer modes (Native, Memory, File) while `WIA` only has two (Memory, File).

## ICA Scanners

![Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-2]({{site.assets}}imgs/Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-2.png)

`ICA Scanners` refer to image scanners which have drivers that have been designed in accordance with the [ImageCaptureCore Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imagecapturecore).

* Facts about ICA

  + ICA is a framework from Apple which is designed to "Browse for media devices and control them programmatically from your app."

  + ICA is supported on macOS X.

* Is my scanner ICA compliant

## MediaDevices Cameras

`MediaDevices Cameras` refer to the cameras which can be accessed via the [MediaDevices interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices). These cameras are either built into desktops / laptops / mobile devices (phones, pads, etc.) or connected vai USB.

> `DirectShow Cameras` and `MediaDevices Cameras` could refer to the same devices which can be accessed either way.

* Is my camera MediaDevices compliant

  + [Recommended] Take advantage of our official demo page

    - Open the [demo page](https://demo.dynamsoft.com/Samples/dwt/Pure-JS-Solution/PureJSSolution.html?utm_source=dwtdocs)

    ![Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-11]({{site.assets}}imgs/Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-11.png)

    - Try showing the video stream and try capturing a frame to see if it works without any errors

## Troubleshooting

* How to exclude WIA sources in the source list

> Applicable to Windows only

There are two ways to achive this

* Set `IfUseTwainDSM` to true

``` javascript
DWObject.IfUseTwainDSM = true;
```

* Filter sources before listing them

``` javascript
var sources = DWObject.GetSourceNames();
for (var i = 0; i < sources.length; i++) {
    if (sources[i].toLowerCase().indexOf('epson') != -1) {
        sources.splice(i, 1);
    }
}
```
